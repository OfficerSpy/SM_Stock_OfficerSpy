# SM_Stock_OfficerSpy
 A library of various stock functions bearing resemblance to game code.

This is heavily based on SE code for convenience and the lazy. As such, many of these functions are rather simplistic with what they do, though some may be recreations of bigger functions.

I may or may not have used some of these in my own plugins.

You are not required to copy all the files. You can copy the specific function that you want to use if you desire. Keep in mind that some functions may use other functions from the same or different file.
